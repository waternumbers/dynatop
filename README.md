# dynatop

This R package contains the core code to perform a dynamic TOPMODEL
simulation. A related package for processing GIS data to set up dynamic TOPMODEL
implimentations can be found
[here](https://waternumbers.github.io/dynatopGIS).

These two packages are intended as successors to the original Dynamic TOPMODEL implimentation in R;
the [dynatopmodel](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=dynatopmodel). Currently
(as a design choice) not all the features of the original package are
implimented. 

If there is a feature or improvement you want or you experience problems
please raise an [issue](https://​github.com/​waternumbers/​dynatop/​issues)
(or better still submit a pull request with alterations or fixes!) rather then contact the
maintainers directly in the first instance.

Thanks goes to the original developers of Dynamic TOPMODEL, [Keith
Beven](https://www.lancaster.ac.uk/lec/about-us/people/keith-beven) and [Jim
Freer](http://www.bristol.ac.uk/geography/people/jim-e-freer/index.html), who
contributed to the original R port of Dynamic TOPMODEL on which this is based.
