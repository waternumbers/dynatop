\title{Initialises the hru states}
\usage{
initialise_hillslope(hillslope, model, init_discharge)

initialise_channel(channel)
}
\arguments{
\item{hillslope}{a property object as generated by initialise_properties with type hillslope}

\item{init_discharge}{steady outflow presumed sum of hillslope saturateed flows [m^3/s]}

\item{channel}{a property object as generated by initialise_properties with type channel}

\item{Wsat}{weighted conectivity matrix for saturated zone}
}
\value{
hillslope with additional feilds relating to the states
}
\description{
The states of the hru are the timevarying characteristics that describe the hru state, they can be both fluxes and storage volumes
}
