\title{Function to compute the time delays between gauges and points in the network}
\usage{
compute_time_delay(model)
}
\arguments{
\item{model}{a dynamic TOPMODEL list object}
}
\value{
A list with two matrices one of time delays between the foot of reaches and the gauges, one with time differences between point inflow and gauges
}
\description{
This function computes the time taken for between point in the network TODO
}
\details{
This is done by a simple search - not very efficent for large networks. The time returned is in h
}
