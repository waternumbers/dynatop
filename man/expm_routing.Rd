\item{K}{matric such that dx/dt = K*s}

\item{dt}{time step to be taken}

\description{
Function to setup the exponential of the matrix for an exponential matrix routing
}
\details{
The current solution is based on inverting the matrix of eigen vectors in the setup step. This means that on each evaluation requires the sonstant in the solution arecomputed using a matrix multiplication. It may be more robust (and memery efficent) to solve for the initial conditions based on the eigen vector matrix instead.

\examples{
# a real value problem
K <- matrix(-1,3,3); diag(K) <- 2
x0 <- c(0,1,5)
dt <- 1

# solution using expm_routing
A <- expm_setup(K,dt)
xhat <- A\%*\%x0

# solution should be
x <- c(2-2*exp(3*dt),2-exp(3*dt),2+3*exp(3*dt))

# so this should be small
x-xhat
}
