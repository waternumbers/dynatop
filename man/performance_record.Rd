\title{Some summaries of dynatop performance}
\format{An object of class \code{list} of length 5.}
\usage{
data(performance_record)
}
\description{
\code{performance_record} contains limited summaries of a computational
performance of the \code{dynatop} function.
These relate purely to the computational efficency of the code, not the hydrological performance of the model.
It is used in the generation of the Performance Evaluation vignette which also documents the production of the data.
