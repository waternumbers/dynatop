\title{Function to check the observations provided to drive a dynamic TOPMODEL run}
\usage{
check_obs(obs, req_series, sub_step = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{obs}{xts object containing the forcing data}

\item{req_series}{a character vector of series that should be in obs}

\item{sub_step}{duration of sub step in model evaluation in hours, default value of NULL results in data time step}
}
\value{
Returns a list containing the time interval for the main and sub step as well and the number of substeps
}
\description{
This function makes some basic consistency checks on the observed data and summaries of the model

\details{
The checks performed and basic 'sanity' checks. they do not check for the logic of parameter values nor the consistncy of states and parameters. The number of sub steps is
