\title{Function to apply variable time delay routing}
\usage{
time_delay_routing(
  model,
  channel_inflows,
  point_inflows = NULL,
  diffuse_inflows = NULL,
  initial_conditions = list()
)
}
\arguments{
\item{model}{a dynamic TOPMODEL list object}

\item{channel_inflows}{an xts object of flows to the channels}

\item{point_inflows}{and xts object of point inflows}

\item{diffuse_inflows}{an xts object of diffuse inflows}

\item{initial_conditions}{a list of initial conditions}
}
\value{
An xts object of flows at the guage locations
}
\description{
This function makes a model along with the specification of a point and inputs to the channel. It applies a time delay historgram routing based on the channel length and velocities.
}
\details{
Timings are taken from the channel_inflows, other inputs are ignored unless there timings match
