\title{Initialises the hru states for a dynatop simulation}
\usage{
initialise(hru, initial_recharge)

create_hru(model)
}
\arguments{
\item{hru}{a list of one or more dynamic TOPMODEL HRUs}

\item{initial_recharge}{Initial recharge to the saturated zone in steady state in m/hr}

\item{model}{a dynamic TOPMODEL model list object}
}
\value{
An altered hru list with states added

A list of lists, one list for each HRU type which contains vectors of states and properties for use in computation
}
\description{
Initialise the states of the different hru types. these can be time varying such as store of fluxes or fixed properties such as parmeter values and areas
