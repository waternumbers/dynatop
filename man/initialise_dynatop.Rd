\title{Initialises the hru states for a dynatop simulation}
\usage{
initialise_hillslope(model, initial_recharge)

initialise_channel(model)

initialise_cpp(hru, initial_recharge)

model_to_hru(model)
}
\arguments{
\item{model}{a dynamic TOPMODEL model list object}

\item{initial_recharge}{Initial recharge to the saturated zone in steady state in m/hr}

\item{hru}{a list of one or more dynamic TOPMODEL HRUs}
}
\value{
A list of lists, one list for each HRU type which contains vectors of states and properties for use in computation

An altered hru list with states added

A list of lists, one list for each HRU type which contains vectors of states and properties for use in computation
}
\description{
Initialise the states of the different hru types. these can be time varying such as store of fluxes or fixed properties such as parmeter values and areas

Initialises the hru states for a dynatop simulation

Initialise the states of the different hru types. these can be time varying such as store of fluxes or fixed properties such as parmeter values and areas

Initialise the states of the different hru types. these can be time varying such as store of fluxes or fixed properties such as parmeter values and areas

This creates and populates the hru table, properties and parameters of the hru
