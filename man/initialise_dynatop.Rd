\title{Initialises the hru states for a dynatop simulation}
\usage{
initialise_dynatop(model, initial_recharge)
}
\arguments{
\item{model}{a dynamic TOPMODEL model list object}

\item{initial_recharge}{Initial recharge to the saturated zone in steady state in m/hr}
}
\value{
A list of lists, one list for each HRU type which contains vectors of states and properties for use in computation
}
\description{
Initialise the states of the different hru types. these can be time varying such as store of fluxes or fixed properties such as parmeter values and areas
}
