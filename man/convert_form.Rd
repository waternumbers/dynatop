\title{Functions for converting between the model forms used in simulation}
\usage{
convert_form(model, used_by = "dynatop")

convert_dynatop(model)

get_states(obj, used_by = "dynatop", type = c("hillslope", "channel"))
}
\arguments{
\item{model}{a dynamic TOPMODEL model list object}

\item{used_by}{which function the transformed model is to be used by}

\item{obj}{a transformed object}

\item{type}{of HSU for which states are to be returned (either hillslope or channel)}
}
\value{
Either the data object used in the simulation or a data.frame of states along with the HSU ID.
}
\description{
Function that convert a dynatop model into forms that are
more useful for simulation and then extract properties from them.
}
\details{
These functions are designed to be used internally by other functions within the package. In general \code{convert_form} with an appropriate \code{used_by} should be used although functions are available directly. \code{get_states} extract the states from a converted object.
