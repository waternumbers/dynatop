#' Some summaries of dynatop performance
#'
#' @description
#' \code{performance_record} contains limited summaries of a computational
#' performance of the \code{dynatop} function.
#' These relate purely to the computational efficency of the code, not the hydrological performance of the model.
#' It is used in the generation of the Performance Evaluation vignette which also documents the production of the data.
