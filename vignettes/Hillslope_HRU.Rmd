# Conceptual model

One of the underlying principles of dynamic TOPMODEL is that the landscape can
be broken up into hydrologically similar regions, or Hydrological Response
Units (HRUs), where all the area within a HRU behaves in a hydrologically
similar fashion. Further discussion and the connection of HRUs is outlined [elsewhere](Notes_on_the_implementation_of_Dynamic_TOPMODEL).

This document outlines the conceptual structure and computational
implementation of the hillslope HRU. The hillslope HRU is a representation of 
an area of hill slope with, for example, similar topographic, soil and upslope area
characteristics.

The hillslope HRU is considered to be a area of hill slope with outflow
occurring across a specified with of it boundary.
It is formed of four zones representing the surface water, which
passes water between HRUs and drains to the root zone. The root zone characterises
the interactions evapotranspiration and precipitation and when full spills to
the unsaturated zone. This drains to the saturated zone which also interacts
with other HRUs. The behaviour of the saturated zone is modelled using a kinematic wave
approximation.

In the following section the governing equations of the hillslope HRU are
given in a finite volume form. For comparison we also outline the equivalent
equations for infinitesimal vertical slab across the outflow width which is in keeping with the
original derivation of Dynamic TOPMODEL. An implicit numerical scheme, valid
for a wide range of transmissivity profiles, in then presented.

# Notation

Table \@ref(tab:hs-x-notation) outlines the notation used for describing an
infinitesimal slab across the hillslope HRU. 

The following conventions are used:

-   All properties such as slope angles and time constants are considered
    uniform along the hillslope.
	
-   Precipitation and Potential Evapotranspiration occur at spatially uniform
    rates.
	
-   All fluxes $r_{\star \rightarrow \star}$ are considered to be positive when
	travelling in the direction of the arrow, but can in cases be negative.

-   All fluxes $l_{\star}$ and $q_{\star}$ are considered to be positive flows travelling downslope.

-   The superscripts $^+$ and $^-$ is used to denote variables for the outflow
    ans inflow to the hillslope.

-   $\left.y\right\rvert_t$ indicates the value of the
    variable $y$ at time $t$

-   Spatial averages are denoted with a $\bar{}$ so for example integrating
over the length of the hillslope $\Delta x$ we find

\begin{equation}
\int\limits_{0}^{\Delta x} wy dx = A\bar{y}
\end{equation}

-   Average values over a time step are denoted with a $\hat{}$. If the
    temporal average is a of a spatial average teh $\bar{}$ is dropped. For
    example the average value of $bar{y}$ over a time step is $\hat{y}$.

# Finite Volume Formulation

In this section a finite volume formulation of the Dynamic TOPMODEL equations
are derived. 

## Surface zone

The storage in the surface zone satisfies $s_{sf} \geq 0$.
Surface storage is increased by lateral downslope flow from upslope HRUs. 
Water flows to the root zone at a constant rate $k_{sf}$, unless limited by
the available storage at the surface or the ability of the root zone to
receive water (for example if the saturation storage deficit is 0 and the root zone storage is full).

In cases where lateral flows in the saturated zone produce
saturation storage deficits water may be returned from the root
zone to the surface giving negative values of $r_{sf \rightarrow rz}$.

The governing ODE can be written as
\begin{equation}
\frac{dws_{sf}}{dt} = - \frac{dq_{sf}}{dx} - wr_{sf \rightarrow rz}
\end{equation}
where $r_{sf \rightarrow rz} \leq k_{sf}$.

Integration over the length $\Delta x$ and subsituting in the spatial averages gives
\begin{equation}
A\frac{d \bar{s}_{sf}}{dt} = q_{sf}^{-} - q_{sf}^{+} - A\bar{r}_{sf \rightarrow rz}
\end{equation}

Dividing through by $w^+$ and re arranging gives
\begin{equation}
\frac{d \bar{s}_{sf}}{dt} = \frac{q_{sf}^{-}/w^{+} - l_{sf}^{+}}{A/w^+} - \bar{r}_{sf \rightarrow rz}
\end{equation}
This equation represents the evolution in time of $\bar{s}_{sf}$ expressed in
terms of the unit width fluxes and an effective length $A/w^+$

To complete the formulation assume that $l_{sf}^{+} = c_{sf}\bar{s}_{sf}$
which gives
\begin{equation}
\frac{d \bar{s}_{sf}}{dt} = \frac{q_{sf}^{-}}{A} - \bar{r}_{sf \rightarrow rz}
- \frac{w^{+}c_{sf}}{A} \bar{s}_{sf}
\end{equation}

### Infinitesimal slab

A similar expression for the evolution can be derived by considering the
infinitesimal slab at the downslope end of the HRU. Taking a discrete
approximation for the change of flow with length the governing ODE can be written as
\begin{equation}
\frac{dw^{+}s_{sf}^{+}}{dt} = \frac{q_{sf}^{-} - q_{sf}^{+}}{\Delta x} - w^{+}r_{sf \rightarrow rz}^{+}
\end{equation}

Dividing through by $w^{+}$ gives
\begin{equation}
\frac{ds_{sf}^{+}}{dt} = \frac{q_{sf}^{-}/w^{+} - l_{sf}^{+}}{\Delta x} - r_{sf \rightarrow rz}^{+}
\end{equation}

Note the similaties between this and the finite volume solution. Infact if
$r_{sf \rightarrow rz}$ is taken to be spatially uniform and 
$\Delta x = A/w^{+}$ then this solution for $s_{sf}^{+}$ will evolve in a similar fashion to
$\bar{s}_{sf}$

## Root zone

The root zone gains water from precipitation and the surface zone. It looses water through
evaporation and to the unsaturated zone. The root zone storage satifies. Since
all the veritcal fluxes are spatially uniform the evolution can be evaluated
in terms of the spatial averages.

\begin{equation} 0 \leq \bar{s}_{rz} \leq s_{rzmax} \end{equation}

with the governing ODE
\begin{equation}
\frac{d\bar{s}_{rz}}{dt} = p - \frac{e_p}{s_{rzmax}} \bar{s}_{rz} +
\bar{r}_{sf\rightarrow rz} - \bar{r}_{rz \rightarrow uz}
\end{equation}

Fluxes from the surface and to the unsaturated zone are
controlled by the level of root zone storage along with the state of the unsaturated
and saturated zones.

For $\bar{s}_{rz} \leq s_{rzmax}$ then $\bar{r}_{rz \rightarrow uz} \leq 0$. Negative
values of $\bar{r}_{rz \rightarrow uz}$ may occur only when water is returned from the
unsaturated zone due to saturation caused by lateral inflow to the saturated zone.

When $\bar{s}_{rz} = s_{rzmax}$ then 
\begin{equation}
p - e_p + \bar{r}_{sf\rightarrow rz} - \bar{r}_{rz \rightarrow uz} \leq 0
\end{equation}
In this case $\bar{r}_{rz \rightarrow uz}$ may be positive if
\begin{equation}
p - e_p + \bar{r}_{sf\rightarrow rz} > 0
\end{equation}
so long as the unsaturated zone can receive the water. If $\bar{r}_{rz
\rightarrow uz}$ is 'throttled' by the rate at which the unsaturated zone can
receive water then $\bar{r}_{sf\rightarrow rz}$ is adjusted (potentially becoming
negative) to ensure the equality is met.

### Infinitesimal slab

The same formulation follows for the infinitesimal slab at the bottom of the
hillslope with the averaged terms (using $\bar{}$) replaced with those valid
at the bottom of the hillsipe (using $^{+}$).

## Unsaturated Zone

The unsaturated zone acts as a non-linear tank subject to the constraint 
\begin{equation} 0 \leq \bar{s}_{uz} \leq \bar{s}_{sz} \end{equation}

The governing ODE is written as
\begin{equation}
\frac{d\bar{s}_{uz}}{dt} = \bar{r}_{rz \rightarrow uz} - \bar{r}_{uz \rightarrow sz}
\end{equation}

If water is able to path freely to the saturated zone then it flows at the rate
$\frac{\bar{s}_{uz}}{T_d \bar{s}_{sz}}$. If $\bar{s}_{sz}=\bar{s}_{uz}=0$ this is interpreted to mean
that the flow rate is $\frac{1}{T_d}$. 
In this situation that $\bar{s}_{sz}=\bar{s}_{uz}$ the subsurface below
the root zone can be considered saturated, as in there is no further available
storage for water, but seperated into parts: an upper part with vertical
flow and a lower part with lateral flux.

It is possible that $\bar{r}_{uz \rightarrow sz}$ is
constrained by the ability of the saturated zone to receive water. If
this is the case $\bar{r}_{uz \rightarrow sz}$ occurs at the maximum
possible rate and $\bar{r}_{rz \rightarrow uz}$ limited to ensure that
$\bar{s}_{uz} \leq \bar{s}_{sz}$.

### Infinitesimal slab

The same formulation follows for the infinitesimal slab at the bottom of the
hillslope with the averaged terms (using $\bar{}$) replaced with those valid
at the bottom of the hillsipe (using $^{+}$).

## Saturated Zone

For the a HRU the alteration of the storage in the saturated zone is
given by
\begin{equation}
\frac{dw\left(D-s_{sz}\right)}{dt} = -\frac{dq_{sz}}{dx} + wr_{uz \rightarrow sz}
\end{equation}

Integration over the length of the hillslope and subsitution of the
spatial averaged values gives
\begin{equation}
-A\frac{d\bar{s}_{sz}}{dt} = q_{sz}^{-} - q_{sz}^{+}  + A\bar{r}_{uz \rightarrow sz}
\end{equation}

Dividing through by $w^+$ and rearranging gives
\begin{equation}
\frac{d\bar{s}_{sz}}{dt} = \frac{l_{sz}^{+} - q_{sz}^{-}/w^{+}}{A/w^{+}} - \bar{r}_{uz \rightarrow sz}
\end{equation}

The Kinematic approximation then depends upon the specification of a relationship
 between $\bar{s}_{sz}$ and $l_{sz}^{+}$. This usually termed the transmivity
 profile however the use of the average, rather then cross sectional saturated
 storage deficit means this term is used only loosly. More generally the
 relationship is taken
to be a one-to-one, continuously differentiable function 
$g: \mathcal{R^{+}}\rightarrow \mathcal{R}^{+}$ which returns the lateral flow on
a unit width such that $l_{sz}^{+} = g\left(\bar{s}_{sz}\right)$ which satifies
\begin{equation}
c_{sz} = -\frac{dl_{sz}^{+}}{d\bar{s}_{sz}} = -\frac{d}{d\bar{s}_{sz}}g\left(\bar{s}_{sz}\right) > 0
\end{equation}

The later condition indicates that $l_{sz}^{+}$ increase with decreasing
$\bar{s}_{sz}$. This is numerically helpful but not strictly required.

Using the relationship between $l_{sz}^{+}$ and $\bar{s}_{sz}$ gives
\begin{equation}
\frac{d\bar{s}_{sz}}{dt} = \frac{w^{+}}{A}g\left(\bar{s}_{sz}\right) - \frac{q_{sz}^{-}}{A} - \bar{r}_{uz \rightarrow sz}
\end{equation}

### Infinitesimal slab

Evaluating for the foot of the hillslope and taking a discrete approximation
of the spatial gradient gives
\begin{equation}
\frac{ds_{sz}^{+}}{dt} = \frac{l_{sz}^{+} - q_{sz}^{-}/w^{+}}{\Delta x} - r_{uz \rightarrow sz}^{+}
\end{equation}

As with the surface zone we see the similarilty in form, indicating that,
subject to the evaluation of the temporal integral, the two formulations
should return the same results when $\Delta x = A/w^{+}$


# Temporal Integration

No analytical solution yet exists simulataneous integration of the system of
ODEs outlined above. 

The basis of the solution is that a gravity driven system will maximise
the downward flow of water within each timestep of size $\Delta t$. We present
two numerical schemes. The first is a simple implicit scheme, where fluxes
between stores are considered constant over the time step and gradients are
evaluated at the final state. The second is a more complex scheme the, given
fluxes between stores are treated as constant over the timestep, the terms are
numerically integrated.

Recall that the temporal and spatial average vertical fluxes are denoted with
a $\hat{}$. and that at the start of the evaluation the

## Implict scheme

In the folloIn the following section an implicit numerical scheme is derived
for a time step $\Delta t$.

The implicit approximations are stated using the unknown vertical fluxes
$\hat{r}_{\star \rightarrow \star}$ which are then determined by maximising the
downward flux.

### Surface excess

The implict scheme gives

\begin{equation}
\left. \bar{s}_{sf}  \right\rvert_{\Delta t}
=
\left. \bar{s}_{sf} \right\rvert_{0}
+ \Delta t \left(
\frac{\hat{q}_{sf}^{-}}{A} - 
\hat{r}_{sf \rightarrow rz}
- \frac{w^{+}c_{sf}}{A} \left. \bar{s}_{sf}  \right\rvert_{\Delta t}
\right)
\end{equation}
or 
\begin{equation}
\left. \bar{s}_{sf}  \right\rvert_{\Delta t}
= \left(1 + \frac{w^{+}c_{sf}}{A}\right)^{-1}
\left( \left. \bar{s}_{sf} \right\rvert_{0}
+ \Delta t \left(
\frac{\hat{q}_{sf}^{-}}{A} - 
\hat{r}_{sf \rightarrow rz}
\right) \right)
\end{equation}

To ensure that the surface storage does not become negative
\begin{equation}
\hat{r}_{sf \rightarrow rz} \leq \min\left( k_{sf},
\left. \bar{s}_{sf} \right\rvert_{0} + \frac{\Delta t \hat{q}_{sf}^{-}}{A}
\right)
\end{equation}

The surface outflow over the time step is evaluated as
\begin{equation}
\hat{q}_{sf}^{+} = \frac{w^{+}c_{sf}}{A} \left. \bar{s}_{sf}  \right\rvert_{\Delta t}
\end{equation}

### Root Zone

The implict formulation for the root zone gives
\begin{equation}
\left. \bar{s}_{rz} \right.\rvert_{\Delta t} = 
\left( 1 + \frac{e_{p}\Delta t}{s_{rzmax}} \right)^{-1}
\left(
\left. \bar{s}_{rz} \right.\rvert_{0}
+ \Delta t \left(
p + \hat{r}_{sf \rightarrow rz} - \hat{r}_{rz \rightarrow uz} \right)
\right)
\end{equation}

Since flow to the unsaturated zone occur only to keep 
$\bar{s}_{rz} \leq s_{rzmax}$ then
\begin{equation}
\hat{r}_{rz \rightarrow uz} \leq \max\left(0,
\frac{1}{\Delta t}\left(
\left. \bar{s}_{rz} \right.\rvert_{0}
+ \Delta t \left(
p + \hat{r}_{sf \rightarrow rz} - e_{p} \right)
- s_{rzmax}
\right)\right)
\end{equation}

### Unsaturated Zone

The expression for the unsaturated zone is given in terms of
$\left. \bar{s}_{uz} \right.\rvert_{\Delta t}$ and 
$\left. \bar{s}_{sz} \right.\rvert_{\Delta t}$ as

\begin{equation}
\left. \bar{s}_{uz} \right.\rvert_{\Delta t} = 
\frac{T_{d}\left. \bar{s}_{sz} \right.\rvert_{\Delta t}}{
T_{d}\left. \bar{s}_{sz} \right.\rvert_{\Delta t} + \Delta t}
\left( \left. \bar{s}_{uz} \right.\rvert_{0} + \Delta t \hat{r}_{rz
\rightarrow uz}\right)
\end{equation}

Since $\left. \bar{s}_{uz} \right.\rvert_{\Delta t} \leq \left. \bar{s}_{sz}
	   \right.\rvert_{\Delta t}$ this places an additional condition of
\begin{equation}
\hat{r}_{rz \rightarrow uz} \leq \frac{1}{\Delta t} \left(
\left. \bar{s}_{sz} \right.\rvert_{\Delta t} + \frac{\Delta t}{T_d} - \left. \bar{s}_{uz} \right.\rvert_{0}\right)
\end{equation}

This condition also implies that $\hat{r}_{uz \rightarrow sz} \leq
								  \frac{1}{T_d}$

## Saturated Zone

Inital evaluation and subsitution of the flux from the unsaturated zone gives
\begin{equation}
\left. \bar{s}_{sz}\right.\rvert_{\Delta t} = 
\left. \bar{s}_{sz}\right.\rvert_{\Delta 0} + \Delta t \left(
\frac{w^{+}}{A}g\left(\left.\bar{s}_{sz}\right\rvert_{\Delta t}\right) -
\frac{q_{sz}^{-}}{A} - \frac{
\left. \bar{s}_{uz} \right.\rvert_{0} + \Delta t \hat{r}_{rz \rightarrow uz} }
{ T_{d}\left. \bar{s}_{sz} \right.\rvert_{\Delta t} + \Delta t}
\right)
\end{equation}

Limiting the inflow by reaching the saturation level gives

\begin{equation}
\hat{r}_{rz \rightarrow uz} \leq \frac{1}{\Delta t}\left(
\left. \bar{s}_{sz}\right.\rvert_{\Delta 0} + \Delta t \left(
\frac{w^{+}}{A}g\left(0\right) -
\frac{q_{sz}^{-}}{A}\right) - \left. \bar{s}_{uz} \right.\rvert_{0} \right)
\end{equation}

Selecting $\bar{s}_{sz}$ to satify the above equation describes a non-linear
problem. However since the LHS is strictly increasing with $\bar{s}_{sz}$,
while the RHS is decreasing so single solution is present and can be reliably
located.

### Algorithm

An implimentation of the above considitions which is consistent with
maximising the downward flux makes use of the psuedo-function 
$f\left(\check{s}_{sz},\check{r}_{rz \rightarrow uz}\right)$ which returns the
value
\begin{equation}
\check{s}_{sz} - 
\left. \bar{s}_{sz}\right.\rvert_{\Delta 0} - \Delta t \left(
\frac{w^{+}}{A}g\left(\check{s}_{sz}\right) -
\frac{q_{sz}^{-}}{A} - \min\left(\frac{1}{T_d},
\frac{ \left. \bar{s}_{uz} \right.\rvert_{0} + \Delta t \check{r}_{rz \rightarrow uz} }
{ T_{d} \check{s}_{sz} + \Delta t} \right)
\right)
\end{equation}

 In implimentation the algorithm takes the following steps:

1. Compute $\check{r}_{sf \rightarrow rz} = \min\left( k_{sf},
\left. \bar{s}_{sf} \right\rvert_{0} + \frac{\Delta t \hat{q}_{sf}^{-}}{A}
\right)$
2. Compute $\check{r}_{rz \rightarrow uz} = \max\left(0, \frac{1}{\Delta t}\left(
\left. \bar{s}_{rz} \right.\rvert_{0} + \Delta t \left( p + \check{r}_{sf
  \rightarrow rz} - e_{p} \right) - s_{rzmax} \right)\right)$
3. Test for saturation. If $f\left(0,\check{r}_{rz \rightarrow uz}\right) \geq
   0$ then goto 4 else goto 5
4. Saturated. Set $\left. \bar{s}_{sz}\right.\rvert_{\Delta t} = 0$ and
$\hat{r}_{rz \rightarrow uz} = \frac{1}{\Delta t}\left(
\left. \bar{s}_{sz}\right.\rvert_{0} + \Delta t \left(
\frac{w^{+}}{A}g\left(0\right) -
\frac{q_{sz}^{-}}{A}\right) - \left. \bar{s}_{uz} \right.\rvert_{0} \right)$,
Goto 7
5. Not saturated: Find $\left. \bar{s}_{sz}\right.\rvert_{\Delta t}$ such that 
$f\left(\left. \bar{s}_{sz}\right.\rvert_{\Delta t},\check{r}_{rz \rightarrow
  uz}\right) = 0$. 
6. Set $\hat{r}_{rz \rightarrow uz} = \min\left(\check{r}_{rz \rightarrow uz},\frac{1}{\Delta t} \left(
\left. \bar{s}_{sz} \right.\rvert_{\Delta t} + \frac{\Delta t}{T_d} -
 \left. \bar{s}_{uz} \right.\rvert_{0}\right)\right)$.
7. Compute $\hat{r}_{sf \rightarrow rz} = \min\left(\check{r}_{sf \rightarrow
  rz}, \frac{1}{\Delta t}\left( s_{rzmax} - 
\left. \bar{s}_{rz} \right.\rvert_{0} - \Delta t \left( p - e_p - \hat{r}_{rz
  \rightarrow uz} \right) \right)\right)$
8. Solve for $\left. \bar{s}_{uz}\right.\rvert_{\Delta t}$,
$\left. \bar{s}_{rz}\right.\rvert_{\Delta t}$ and
$\left. \bar{s}_{sf}\right.\rvert_{\Delta t}$ using the computed vertical
fluxes.

### Solving in terms of the lateral flux

The Finite volume formulations for the surface and saturated zones can be
written in terms of the lateral flux rather then storage. 
For the surface the constant celerity $c_{sf}$ leads to an identical implicit
scheme regardless of which variables is used. 
For the saturated zone multiplying through the through the expression for the
evolutions of $\bar{s}_{sz}$ over time by the celerity gives
\begin{equation}
\frac{dl_{sz}^{+}}{dt} = c_{sz}\left(\frac{q_{sz}^{-}}{A} + \bar{r}_{uz
\rightarrow sz} - \frac{w^{+}l_{sz}^{+}}{A}\right)
\end{equation}
giving rise to the implicit scheme, expressed in terms of $\bar{s}_{sz}$ of
\begin{equation}
g \left(\left. \bar{s}_{sz}\right.\rvert_{\Delta t} \right) = 
g\left( \left. \bar{s}_{sz}\right.\rvert_{\Delta 0} \right) + 
c_{sz}\left(\left. \bar{s}_{sz}\right.\rvert_{\Delta t}\right) \Delta t \left(
\frac{q_{sz}^{-}}{A} + \frac{
\left. \bar{s}_{uz} \right.\rvert_{0} + \Delta t \hat{r}_{rz \rightarrow uz} }
{ T_{d}\left. \bar{s}_{sz} \right.\rvert_{\Delta t} + \Delta t} -
\frac{w^{+}}{A}g\left(\left.\bar{s}_{sz}\right\rvert_{\Delta t}\right)\right)
\end{equation}

Whether a valid solution of this can be found, and if the resulting estimate
of $\hat{l}_{sz}^{+}$, which can be computed by mass balance \footnote{This is
why the current scheme is wrong!}, is non-negative will depend upon the properties of
$g\left(\bar{s}_{sz}\right)$.
