The `dynatop` function in the dynamic TOPMODEL R package implements a set of numerical solutions to the
governing equations of the dynamic TOPMODEL hillslope formulation. This
returns the inflow to the channel reachs specified in the model. 
This vignette documents the formulation and the numerical solution used to route these channel inflows, along with other diffuse and point inputs to the model.

Later we make use of the following:

-   Superscript notation $^{\left[i\right]}$ to indicate the property of
    the $i$th channel length

-   Bold lower case letter to indicate the column vector of quantities from all
    HRUs, e.g.
    $\mathbf{q}_{rz} = \left(q_{rz}^{\left[1\right]},\ldots,q_{rz}^{\left[n\right]}\right)^{T}$

-   Bold uppercase letters to indicate matrices which may be diagonal if
    the underlying variables is a vector (e.g. $\mathbf{A}$ is a
    diagonal matrix of area) or dense (e.g. $W_{sz}$ where the $j$th
    element of the $i$th row is $w_{sz}^{\left[i,j\right]}$). 
	
-	The identity matrix is written as $\mathbf{I}$. The notation $\mathbf{0}$
     is used to indicate a matrix of vector of zeros whose size can be inferred
     from its location.

-   The notation $\left.x\right\rvert_t$ to indicate the value of the
    variable $x$ at time $t$
	
-	To illustrate some calculations intermediate evaluations variables are
     computed. To distinguish these a $\tilde{}$ is used. For example
	 $\tilde{q}_{rz}$ is an intermediate value in the computation of
     $q_{rz}$. In some cases these values may evolve across multiple
     steps. Where needed the superscript $^\left[-\right]$ will be used to
     indicate the value at the start of the step and $^\left[+\right]$ that at
     the end.
     
# Time Delay Channel Routing

Using a time delay routing approach the discharge at the gauge $g$ at time $t$ can be computed from the inflows of the upstream points on the channel newtork $x \in \mathcal{X}$ and the time it takes the effect of the inflow to been seen at the gauge $\delta_{x\rightarrow g}$ as
\[
q\left(g,t\right) = \int_{x\in\mathcal{X}} h\left(x,t-\delta_{x\rightarrow g}\right) dx
\]

The conceptualisation of Dynamic Topmodel breaks the channel network down into
$n$ disjoint channel HRUs whose inflows contribute to the discharge at the
gauge giving
\[
q\left(g,t\right) = \sum\limits_{i=1}^{n} \int_{x\in\mathcal{X}_{i}}
h\left(x,t-\delta_{x\rightarrow g}\right) dx 
\]

<!-- While the instantaneous discharge is usefull it may be more consistent with the conceptualisation of the hillslope HRU model, and with a mass conservative apporach, to model the integral of the discharge over a time step $\Delta t$. In this case a similar relationship holds for the average discharge over the time step in that -->
<!-- \[ -->
<!-- \frac{1}{\Delta t} \int_{0}^{\Delta t}q\left(g,t-\tau\right) d\tau = \sum\limits_{i=1}^{n} \frac{1}{\Delta t}\int_{0}^{\Delta t}\int_{x\in\mathcal{X}_{i}} -->
<!-- h\left(x,t-\tau-\delta_{x\rightarrow g}\right) dx d\tau -->
<!-- \] -->

# Numerical Solution


Consider the contribution to the gauges flow from a single channel HRU
\[
\int_{x\in\mathcal{X}_{i}}
h\left(x,t-\delta_{x\rightarrow g}\right) dx d\tau
\]

To further derive the numerical solution a number of assumpptions are made.
The first assumption is that the channel represents a single reach of river such the a spatial location $x \in \mathcal{X}_{i}$ can be replaced by a unique length $l$ from the head of the reach. The maximum value of $l$, denoted$\tilde{L}$, is the lower of the length of the reach $L$ or the distance to the gauge from the head of the reach.
The contribution of the channel HRU to the gauged flow can be expressed as
\[
\int_{0}^{\tilde{L}}
h\left(l,t-\delta_{l\rightarrow g}\right) dl
\]

The second assumption is that there is a constant effecive velocity $v$ within the reach. The time delay $\delta_{l\rightarrow g}$ can then be written in terms of the time delay for the head of the reach  $\delta_{0\rightarrow g}$ as
\[
\delta_{l\rightarrow g} = \delta_{0\rightarrow g} - lv^{-1}
\]
The contribution of the channel HRU to the discharge at the gauge then becomes
\[
\int_{0}^{\tilde{L}}
h\left(l,t-\delta_{0\rightarrow g}+lv^{-1}\right) dl
\]

Since the model is solved in discrete time the interal can be divided up into
time steps.
Let $d_{min}$ be the largest and $d_{max}$ the smallest integers such that $d_{min} < d_{max}$ and
\[
d_{min}\Delta t < \delta_{0\rightarrow g}-\tilde{L}v^{-1} <
\delta_{0\rightarrow g} < d_{max}\Delta t
\]
Then taking $\Delta l = v\Delta t$  we can divide the integral up to give
\[
\sum\limits_{j=d_{min}}^{d_{max}-1} \int_{0}^{\Delta l}
h\left(l,t-j\Delta lv^{-1}-\lambda v^{-1}\right) d\lambda
- \int_{0}^{\delta_{0\rightarrow g}-\tilde{L}v^{-1} - d_{min}\Delta lv^{-1}}
h\left(l,t-d_{min}\Delta lv^{-1}-\lambda v^{-1}\right) d\lambda
- \int_{\delta_{0\rightarrow g} - \left(d_{max}-1\right)\Delta
  lv^{-1}}^{\Delta l} h\left(l,t-\left(d_{max}-1\right)\Delta lv^{-1}-\lambda v^{-1}\right) d\lambda
\]

The second assumption is that there is no spatial pattern in the inflow to the
reach and constant inflow over time steps so that we can write 
\[
h\left(l,t-\tau\right) = \bar{h}_{t} \quad \forall
l\in\left(0,L\right),\tau\in\left(0,\Delta t\right)
\]
an express the contribution to the gauged flow as
\[
\sum\limits_{j=d_{min}}^{d_{max}-1} \Delta l \bar{h}_{t-j\Delta lv^{-1}}
- \left(\delta_{0\rightarrow g}v - d_{min}\Delta l - \tilde{L}\right)
\bar{h}_{t-d_{min}\Delta l v^{-1}}
- \left( d_{max}\Delta l - \delta_{0\rightarrow g}v \right) \bar{h}_{t-\left(d_{max}-1\right)\Delta lv^{-1}}
\]

This can now be expressed in terms of a polynomial of the the backward shift operator $z^{-1}$
\[
B\left(z^{-1}\right) = \left(\Delta l - \left(\delta_{0\rightarrow g}v -
d_{min}\Delta l - \tilde{L}\right)\right) + \Delta l z^{-1} + \ldots + \Delta l
z^{-(d_{max}-d_{min}-1)} + \left(\Delta l - \left(d_{max}\Delta l - \delta_{0\rightarrow g}v\right)\right) z^{-(d_{max}-d_{min}-1)}
\]
as
\[
B\left(z^{-1}\right) \bar{h}_{t-d_{min}\Delta t}
\]

This shows that the instanaeous flow at the outlet can be approximated
from the $\bar{h}_{t-d_{min}\Delta t}$ by a linear operation.
It remains to be shown that $\bar{h}_{t-d_{min}\Delta t}$ can be related to
the output of the `dynatop` function which is
\[
\frac{1}{\Delta t}
\int_{0}^{\Delta t}\int_{x\in\mathcal{X}_{i}}
h\left(x,t-\tau \right) dx d\tau
\]
Under the channel routing assumptions
\[
\frac{1}{\Delta t}
\int_{0}^{\Delta t}\int_{x\in\mathcal{X}_{i}}
h\left(x,t-\tau \right) dx d\tau =
\frac{1}{\Delta t}
\int_{0}^{\Delta t}\int_{0}^{L}
h\left(l,t-\tau \right) dl d\tau =
L \bar{h}_{t}
\]

The contribution to the discharge at the channel outlet is therefore a linear
filtering of the output of `dynatop`. From summing the coeffiecnts of
$B\left(z^{-1}\right)$ the fraction of the `dynatop` output returned as
discharge at the gauge is $\tilde{L}/L$. This implies mass conservation the
inputs of channel HRUs above the gauge, while if the gauge is sited within the
HRU mass is proportional to the fraction fo the reach above it.
