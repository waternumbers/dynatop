# Conceptual model

One of the underlying principles of dynamic TOPMODEL is that the landscape can
be broken up into hydrologically similar regions, or Hydrological Similarity
Units (HSUs), where all the area within a HSU behaves in a hydrologically
similar fashion. Further discussion and the conection of HSUs is discussed
further in [ref].

This document outlines the conceptual structure and computational
implimentation of the hillslope HSU. The hillslope HSU is a representation of 
an area of hillslope with, for example, simliar topgraphic, soil and upslope area
characteristics.

The hillslope HSU is considered to be a hillslope with inflow and outflow
occuring at parallel edges seperated by a distance $\Delta x$.
It is formed of four zones representing the surface water, which
passes water between HSUs and drains to the root zone. The root zone characterises
the interactions evapotranspiration and precipitation and when full spills to
the unsaturated zone. This drains to the saturated zone which also interacts
with other HSUs. The behaviour of the saturated zone is modelled using a kinematic wave
approximation.

In the following section the governing equations of the hillslope HSU are
given for an infinitesimal vertical slab. The application of the cross
sectional solution to the hillslope HSU is then considered and a numerical scheme is presented.
	
# Notation

Table \@ref(tab:hs-x-notation) outlines the notation used for describing an
infinitesimal slab across the hillslope HSU. 

The following conventions are used:

-   All properties such as slope angles and time constants are considered
    uniform along the hillslope.
	
-   Precipitation and Potential Evapotranspiration occur at spatially uniform
    rates.
	
-   All fluxes $r_{* \rightarrow *}$ are considered to be positive when
	travelling in the direction of the arrow, but can in cases be negative.

-   All fluxes $l_{*}$ are considered to be positive flows travelling downslope.

-   The superscript $^-$ is used to denote variables at the top cross sections of the hillslope.

-   $\left.x\right\rvert_t$ indicates the value of the
    variable $x$ at time $t$

# Equations for an Infinitesimal Slab

Consider a infinitesimal vertical slab across the hillslope. We use a vertical
slab in the belief that the vertical fluxes are gravity driven. However
lateral fluxes occur do not occur in the horozontal plane, meaning our solution
should, were appropraite allow for this.

## Surface zone

The storage in the surface zone satisfies $s_{sf} \geq 0$.
Surface storage is increased by lateral downslope flow from upslope HSUs. 
Water flows to the root zone at a constant rate $k_{sf}$, unless limited by
the available storage at the surface or the ability of the root zone to
receive water (for example if the saturation storage deficit is 0 and the root zone storage is full).

In cases where lateral flows in the saturated zone produce
saturation storage deficits water may be returned from the root
zone to the surface giving negative values of $r_{sf \rightarrow rz}$.

The governing ODE can be written as
\begin{equation}
\frac{ds_{sf}}{dt} = - \frac{dl_{sf}}{dx} - r_{sf \rightarrow rz}
\end{equation}
where $r_{sf \rightarrow rz} \leq k_{sf}$.

Assuming a constant celerity the lateral flux is proportional to storage and taking $l_{sf} = c_{sf}s_{sf}$ gives
\begin{equation}
\frac{1}{c_{sf}} \frac{dl_{sf}}{dt} = -\frac{dl_{sf}}{dx} - r_{sf \rightarrow rz}
\end{equation}

## Root zone

The root zone gains water from precipitation and the surface zone. It looses water through
evaporation and to the unsaturated zone. The root zone storage satifies

\begin{equation} 0 \leq s_{rz} \leq s_{rzmax} \end{equation}

with the governing ODE
\begin{equation}
\frac{ds_{rz}}{dt} = p - \frac{e_p}{s_{rzmax}} s_{rz} +
r_{sf\rightarrow rz} - r_{rz \rightarrow uz}
\end{equation}

Fluxes from the surface and to the unsaturated zone are
controlled by the level of root zone storage along with the state of the unsaturated
and saturated zones.

For $s_{rz} \leq s_{rzmax}$ then $r_{rz \rightarrow uz} \leq 0$. Negative
values of $r_{rz \rightarrow uz}$ may occur only when water is returned from the
unsaturated zone due to saturation caused by lateral inflow to the saturated zone.

When $s_{rz} = s_{rzmax}$ then 
\begin{equation}
p - e_p + r_{sf\rightarrow rz} - r_{rz \rightarrow uz} \leq 0
\end{equation}
In this case $r_{rz \rightarrow uz}$ may be positive if
\begin{equation}
p - e_p + r_{sf\rightarrow rz} > 0
\end{equation}
so long as the unsaturated zone can receive the water. If $r_{rz
\rightarrow uz}$ is 'throttled' by the rate at which the unsaturated zone can
receive water then $r_{sf\rightarrow rz}$ is adjusted (potentially becoming
negative) to ensure the equality is met.

## Unsaturated zone

The unsaturated zone acts as a non-linear tank subject to the constraint 
\begin{equation} 0 \leq s_{uz} \leq s_{sz} \end{equation}

The governing ODE is written as
\begin{equation}
\frac{ds_{uz}}{dt} = r_{rz \rightarrow uz} - r_{uz \rightarrow sz}
\end{equation}

If water is able to path freely to the saturated zone then it flows at the rate
$\frac{s_{uz}}{T_d s_{sz}}$. If $s_{sz}=s_{uz}=0$ this is interpreted to mean
that the flow rate is $\frac{1}{T_d}$. 
In this situation that $s_{sz}=s_{uz}$ the subsurface below
the root zone can be considered saturated, as in there is no further available
storage for water, but seperated into parts: an upper part with vertical
flow and a lower part with lateral flux.

It is possible that $r_{uz \rightarrow sz}$ is
constrained by the ability of the saturated zone to receive water. If
this is the case $r_{uz \rightarrow sz}$ occurs at the maximum
possible rate and $r_{rz \rightarrow uz}$ limited to ensure that $s_{uz} \leq s_{sz}$.

## Saturated zone

The change in saturated zone storage deficit is
evaluated using a kinematic wave approximation. 

The continuity equation gives gives the conservation of mass in terms of the
cross sectional zone flow depth $s$ and recharge $r_{uz \rightarrow
  sz}$ as
\begin{equation}
\frac{ds}{dt} + \frac{dl_{sz}}{dx} -r_{uz \rightarrow sz} = 0
\end{equation}

The cross sectional flow depth $s$ can be expressed in terms
of $s_{sat}$ the cross sectional flow depth when the whole cross section has
lateral flux ($s_{sz}=0$) and $s_{sz}$ since $s = s_{sat}-s_{sz}$ giving
\begin{equation}
\frac{ds_{sz}}{dt} = \frac{dl_{sz}}{dx} - r_{uz \rightarrow sz}
\end{equation}
The relationship between $l_{sz}$ and $s_{sz}$ gives the kinematic
velocity or celerity
\begin{equation}
c_{sz} = -\frac{dl_{sz}}{ds_{sz}}
\end{equation}
This allows the governing equation for the saturated zone to be written
\begin{equation}
\frac{1}{c_{sz}}\frac{dl_{sz}}{dt} = -\frac{dl_{sz}}{dx} + r_{uz \rightarrow sz}
\end{equation}

The Kinematic approximation then depends upon the specification of a
transmissivity profile linking $s_{sz}$, $l_{sz}$ and $c_{sz}$. This is taken
to be a one-to-one, continuously differentiable function 
$g: \mathcal{R^{+}}\rightarrow \mathcal{R}^{+}$ which returns the lateral flow on
a unit width such that $l_{sz} = g\left(s_{sz}\right)$ which satifies
\begin{equation}
c_{sz} = -\frac{dl_{sz}}{ds_{sz}} = -\frac{d}{ds_{sz}}g\left(s_{sz}\right) > 0
\end{equation}
and 
\begin{equation}
\frac{dc_{sz}}{ds_{sz}} < 0
\end{equation}

The later two conditions on the first and second differential fo $g$ imply
that both the $l_{sz}$ and $c_{sz}$ increase with decreasing $s_{sz}$ taking
there maximums $l_{szmax}$ and $c_{szmax}$ when $s_{sz}=0$.

# Numerical Solution for the hillslope HRU

No analytical solution yet exists allowing for the evaluation of the
properties at every cross section within the hillslope a numerical
approximation is required.

Two basic approaches could be used for deriving a numerical solution. The
first is to integrate over the length of the
hillslope. This allows for a fully mass conservative solution at the cost of
loosing some properties relating to the length and shape of the hillslope. An
alternative method utilised both here and in the original Dynamic TOPMODEL
implimentation is to solve for the cross section at the foot of the
hillslope. This solution maintains the length properties of the hillslope
while providing adequate information for the transfer of water within the
catchment.

In the remainder of this section a fully implicit numerical scheme is presented. The
inherent stability of this scheme comes at the cost of solving a single, well
defined, zero crossing problem.

The basis of the solution is that a gravity driven system will maximise
the downward flow of water within each timestep of size $\Delta t$. To this
end the solution is developed in four stages. First the implicit
approximations to the partial differential equations are given. Following this
the maximum downwards fluxes between the four layers are derived. The third
stage develops the solution to the saturated zone while the final stage
cascading any throttling of the downward flux back to the surface.

## Implicit apporximations to the PDEs

Evaluating the infinitesimal slab at the foot of the hillslope requires using
approximations to the gradients  with repect to time but also with respect to the lateral
fluxes along the hillslope. 

When only the total inflows $q^{-}_{sf}$ and $q^{-}_{sz}$ to the hillsope are
known we take the unit width inflows to be $l^{-}_{sf} = \frac{q^{-}_{sf}}{w}$
and $l^{-}_{sz} = \frac{q^{-}_{sz}}{w}$. A finite difference gradient
representation gives for the surface zone

\begin{equation}
\frac{1}{c_{sf}}\frac{dl_{sf}}{dt} = \frac{1}{\Delta x}\left(l_{sf}^{-} - l_{sf}\right) - r_{sf \rightarrow rz}
\end{equation}

A similar approach applied to the saturated zone yields
\begin{equation}
\frac{1}{c_{sz}}\frac{dl_{sz}}{dt} = \frac{1}{\Delta
x}\left(l_{sz}^{-} - l_{sz}\right) + r_{uz \rightarrow sz}
\end{equation}

# Numerical Scheme

In the following section an implicit numerical scheme is derived for a time step
$\Delta t$. 



The implicit approximations to the four ODE defining the model using
the unknown vertical fluxes $r_{* \rightarrow *}$ are

\begin{equation}
\left. l_{sf} \right\rvert_{t+\Delta t} = 
\left( 1+ \lambda_{sf} \right)^{-1}
\left(
\left. l_{sf} \right\rvert_{t} + 
\lambda_{sf} \left(
\frac{ \left. q_{sf}^{-} \right\rvert_{t+\Delta t}}{w} - 
\Delta x \left. r_{sf \rightarrow rz} \right\rvert_{t+\Delta t}
\right)
\right)
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
\left. s_{rz} \right\rvert_{t+\Delta t} = 
\left(1 + \frac{e_p\Delta t}{s_{rzmax}}\right)^{-1} \left(
\left. s_{rz} \right\rvert_{t} + p\Delta t +
\Delta t \left. r_{sf \rightarrow rz} \right\rvert_{t+\Delta t} - 
\Delta t \left. r_{rz \rightarrow uz}\right\rvert_{t+\Delta t}\right)
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
\left. s_{uz} \right\rvert_{t+\Delta t} = 
\left. s_{uz} \right\rvert_{t} +
\Delta t \left(
\left.r_{rz \rightarrow uz}\right\rvert_{t+\Delta t} -
\left.r_{uz \rightarrow sz}\right\rvert_{t+\Delta t}
\right)
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
\left. l_{sz} \right\rvert_{t+\Delta t} =
\left(1 + \left. \lambda_{sz} \right\rvert_{t+\Delta t}\right)^{-1}
\left(
\left. l_{sz} \right\rvert_{t} +
\left. \lambda_{sz} \right\rvert_{t+\Delta t} \left(
\frac{ \left. q_{sz}^{-} \right\rvert_{t+\Delta t} }{w} +
\Delta x
\left.r_{uz \rightarrow sz}\right\rvert_{t+\Delta t}
\right)\right)
\end{equation}

where
\begin{equation}
\lambda_{sf} = \frac{c_{sf}\Delta t}{\Delta x}
\end{equation}
and
\begin{equation}
\lambda_{sz} = \frac{c_{sz} \Delta t}{\Delta x}
\end{equation}

Now consider the evaluation of the unknown vertical fluxes. To
maintain $\left. l_{sf} \right\rvert_{t+\Delta t} \geq 0$ requires that
\begin{equation}
\left. r_{sf \rightarrow uz} \right\rvert_{t+\Delta t} \leq 
r_{sf \rightarrow uz}^{pos} = \min\left( k_{sf}, 
\left(\lambda_{sf}\Delta x\right)^{-1}
\left( \left. l_{sf} \right\rvert_{t} + 
\frac{\lambda_{sf}}{w}\left. q_{sf}^{-} \right\rvert_{t+\Delta t} \right)
\right)
\end{equation}

The upper limit of $a_{rz}$ and maximum flux from the surface store
result in
\begin{equation}
 \left. r_{rz \rightarrow uz}\right\rvert_{t+\Delta t} \leq
 r_{rz \rightarrow uz}^{pos} =  \frac{1}{\Delta t} \max\left( 0,
\left. s^{+}_{rz} \right\rvert_{t} + p\Delta t +
\Delta t r_{sf \rightarrow rz}^{pos} - e_p\Delta t - s_{rzmax}\right)
\end{equation}

From the unsaturated zone the implict solution when drainage to the saturated
zone occurs at rate $\frac{s_{uz}}{T_d s_{sz}}$ gives
\begin{equation}
\left. s_{uz} \right\rvert_{t+\Delta t} = 
\frac{T_d \left. s_{sz} \right\rvert_{t+\Delta t}}
{T_d \left. s_{sz} \right\rvert_{t+\Delta t} + \Delta t}
\left(
\left. s_{uz} \right\rvert_{t} + \Delta t \left.r_{rz \rightarrow
uz}\right\rvert_{t+\Delta t}\right)
\end{equation}
Combining this with the limit on $r_{uz \rightarrow sz}$ gives

\begin{equation}
\left. r_{uz \rightarrow sz}\right\rvert_{t+\Delta t}
\leq \min\left(
\frac{\left. s_{uz} \right\rvert_{t} + \Delta t \left.r_{rz \rightarrow
uz}\right\rvert_{t+\Delta t}}
{T_d \left. s_{sz} \right\rvert_{t+\Delta t} + \Delta t}, \frac{1}{T_d}\right)
\end{equation}

The maximum possible flux to the saturated zone then occurs when
$\left. s_{sz} \right\rvert_{t+\Delta t}=0$ as
\begin{equation}
r_{uz \rightarrow sz}^{pos}
= \min\left(
\frac{\left. s_{uz} \right\rvert_{t} + \Delta t r_{rz \rightarrow uz}^{pos}}
{\Delta t}, \frac{1}{T_d}\right)
\end{equation}

Rearranging the evolution of the saturated storage defict gives
\begin{equation}
\left.r_{uz \rightarrow sz}\right\rvert_{t+\Delta t} = 
\frac{1}{\left.\lambda_{sz}\right\rvert_{t+\Delta t} \Delta x}\left(
\left(1 + \left.\lambda_{sz}\right\rvert_{t+\Delta t}\right)
\left. l_{sz} \right\rvert_{t+\Delta t} -
\left. l_{sz} \right\rvert_{t}
- \frac{1}{w}\left.\lambda_{sz}\right\rvert_{t+\Delta t} 
\left. q^{-}_{sz} \right\rvert_{t+\Delta t}
\right)
\end{equation}

Let us assume that $\left.\lambda_{sz}\right\rvert_{t+\Delta t}$ is specified
in such a way that the right hand side of the above expression is
monotonically increasing with respect to $\left.l_{sz}\right\rvert_{t+\Delta
t}$ and hence maximised when 
$\left. l_{sz} \right\rvert_{t+\Delta t} = l_{szmax}$. 
This limits the potential value of of the vertical flux such that
\begin{equation}
\left.r_{uz \rightarrow sz}\right\rvert_{t+\Delta t} \leq r_{uz \rightarrow sz}^{0} = 
\frac{1}{\left.\lambda_{sz}\right\rvert_{t+\Delta t} \Delta x}\left(
\left(1 + \left.\lambda_{sz}\right\rvert_{t+\Delta t}\right)
l_{szmax} -
\left. l_{sz} \right\rvert_{t}
- \frac{1}{w}\left.\lambda_{sz}\right\rvert_{t+\Delta t} 
\left. q^{-}_{sz} \right\rvert_{t+\Delta t}
\right)
\end{equation}

On the principle of maximising the downward flux two cases can be
distiguished:

1.  Case 1: $r_{uz \rightarrow sz}^{pos} \geq r_{uz \rightarrow sz}^{0}$. In
    this case $\left. l^{+}_{sz} \right\rvert_{t+\Delta t} = l_{szmax}$ and 
	$\left.r_{uz \rightarrow sz}\right\rvert_{t+\Delta t} = r_{uz \rightarrow
    sz}^{0}$
	
2.  Case 2: $r_{uz \rightarrow sz}^{pos} < r_{uz \rightarrow sz}^{0}$
	In this case $\left.l_{sz}\right\rvert_{t+\Delta t} \leq l_{szmax}$ and
	satisfies
	the equation of the implicit solution where
\begin{equation}
\left.r_{uz \rightarrow sz}\right\rvert_{t+\Delta t} = 
\min \left(
\frac{ \left. s_{uz} \right\rvert_{t} + \Delta t r_{rz \rightarrow uz}^{pos}}
{T_d \left. s_{sz} \right\rvert_{t+\Delta t} + \Delta t},
\frac{1}{T_d} \right)
\end{equation}

Given the solution to one of the two cases 
\begin{equation}
\left. s_{uz} \right\rvert_{t + \Delta t} =
\left. r_{uz \rightarrow sz} \right\rvert_{t + \Delta t}
T_d
\left. s_{sz} \right\rvert_{t +\Delta t}
\end{equation}
and
\begin{equation}
\left. r_{rz \rightarrow uz} \right\rvert_{t + \Delta t} =
\frac{1}{\Delta t}\left(
\left. s_{uz} \right\rvert_{t + \Delta t} - \left. s_{uz} \right\rvert_{t}
\right) +
\left. r_{uz \rightarrow sz} \right\rvert_{t + \Delta t}
\end{equation}

The remaining vertical flow can then be solved for since
\begin{equation}
\left.r_{sf \rightarrow rz} \right\rvert_{t+\Delta t} = \min\left(
r_{sf \rightarrow rz}^{pos},
\frac{1}{\Delta t}\left(s_{rzmax} - \left. s_{rz} \right\rvert_{t}\right) +
e_p - p + \left. r_{rz \rightarrow uz} \right\rvert_{t + \Delta
  t} \right)
\end{equation}

Subsitution of these fluxes into the initial implicit solutions for the
surface and root zone gives the states at $t+\Delta t$.

## Evaluation of $\lambda_{sz}$

In the numerical solution it is assumed that
$\left.\lambda_{sz}\right\rvert_{t+\Delta t}$ is specified in such a way that 
\begin{equation}
\frac{1}{\left.\lambda_{sz}\right\rvert_{t+\Delta t} \Delta x}\left(
\left(1 + \left.\lambda_{sz}\right\rvert_{t+\Delta t}\right)
\left. l_{sz} \right\rvert_{t+\Delta t} -
\left. l_{sz} \right\rvert_{t}
- \frac{1}{w}\left.\lambda_{sz}\right\rvert_{t+\Delta t} 
\left. q^{-}_{sz} \right\rvert_{t+\Delta t}
\right)
\end{equation}
is montonically increasing with respect to
$\left.l_{sz}\right\rvert_{t+\Delta t}$. This serves two
purposes. The first is that it allows the specification of a unique value $\left.r_{uz
\rightarrow sz}^{0}\right\rvert_{t+\Delta t}$ the maximum vertical inflow
possible while maintaining $l_{sz} \leq l_{szmax}$.
The second is ensuring a unique solution to
$\left.l_{sz}\right\rvert_{t+\Delta t}$. 
This can be seen by writing the condition satified by a Case 2 solution as
\begin{equation}
\min \left(
\frac{ \left. s_{uz} \right\rvert_{t} + \Delta t r_{rz \rightarrow uz}^{pos}}
{T_d \left. s_{sz} \right\rvert_{t+\Delta t} + \Delta t},
\frac{1}{T_d} \right) = \frac{1}{\left.\lambda_{sz}\right\rvert_{t+\Delta t} \Delta x}\left(
\left(1 + \left.\lambda_{sz}\right\rvert_{t+\Delta t}\right)
\left. l_{sz} \right\rvert_{t+\Delta t} -
\left. l_{sz} \right\rvert_{t}
- \frac{1}{w}\left.\lambda_{sz}\right\rvert_{t+\Delta t} 
\left. q^{-}_{sz} \right\rvert_{t+\Delta t}
\right)
\end{equation}
Noting the relationshipe between $s_{sz}$ and $l_{sz}$ we see that the left
hand side is decreasing while the right hand side is strictly increasing,
hence there is a unique solution which is ameanable to location by numerical
techniques.

Through its relationship with $c_{sz}$ the value of $\lambda_{sz}$ has a
direct relationship to $l_{sz}$ and the tranmissivity function $g$. This
suggests that individual transmissity functions should be considered on a
case-by-case basis. For example the exponential transmisity profile is defined
as
\begin{equation}
l_{sz} = T_{0}\sin\beta \exp\left(-\frac{\cos\beta}{m}s_{sz}\right)
\end{equation}
which results in 
\begin{equation}
c_{sz} =
\frac{\cos\beta}{m}T_{0}\sin\beta\exp\left(-\frac{\cos\beta}{m}s_{sz}\right) =
\frac{\cos\beta}{m}l_{sz}
\end{equation}
and
\begin{equation}
\lambda_{sz} = \frac{\Delta t\cos\beta}{m\Delta x}l_{sz}=\alpha l_{sz}
\end{equation}

Subsituing this into the above expression gives
\begin{equation}
\frac{1}{\alpha \Delta x}\left(
1 + \alpha \left.l_{sz}\right\rvert_{t+\Delta t} -
\frac{\left.l_{sz}\right\rvert_{t}}{\left.l_{sz}\right\rvert_{t+\Delta t}} -
\frac{\alpha}{w}\left. q^{-}_{sz} \right\rvert_{t+\Delta t}
\right)
\end{equation}
which is clearly monotonically increasing with respect to $\left. l_{sz}
\right\rvert_{t+\Delta t}$ so long as $\alpha>0$.

A more generally valid, if not fully implict solution, can be generated by
evaluating $\left. \lambda_{sz}\right\rvert_{t+\Delta t} > 0$ using $\left. l_{sz}
\right\rvert_{t}$ rather then $\left. l_{sz}
\right\rvert_{t + \Delta t}$ to give an explicit estimate of $c_{sz}$

# Going further with Exponential Transmissivity

The numerical solution above requires the solution of a well defined numerical
problem. replacing this with a single calculation offers the possibility of
significantly speeding up simulations of the model.

Using the exponential transmissity profile defined in the previous section it
is possible to determine that
\begin{equation}
r^{0}_{uz \rightarrow sz} = \frac{1}{\alpha \Delta x}\left(
1 + \alpha l_{szmax} -
\frac{\left.l_{sz}\right\rvert_{t}}{l_{szmax}} -
\frac{\alpha}{w}\left. q^{-}_{sz} \right\rvert_{t+\Delta t}
\right)
\end{equation}

The solution to Case 1 is straightforward. Case 2 requires the
solution of the original implicit approximation which can be expressed as
\begin{equation}
\left. l_{sz} \right\rvert_{t+\Delta t} + \alpha \left. l_{sz}^2 \right\rvert_{t+\Delta t}=
\left. l_{sz} \right\rvert_{t} +
\alpha \left. l_{sz} \right\rvert_{t+\Delta t} \left(
\frac{ \left. q_{sz}^{-} \right\rvert_{t+\Delta t} }{w} +
\Delta x
\left.r_{uz \rightarrow sz}\right\rvert_{t+\Delta t}
\right)
\end{equation}

which is complex due to the dependence of 
$\left.r_{uz \rightarrow sz}\right\rvert_{t+\Delta t}$ on
$\left.l_{sz}\right\rvert_{t+\Delta t}$.

A numerically convinient approximation can be produced by considering an explicit
approximation of $\left.r_{uz \rightarrow sz}\right\rvert_{t+\Delta t}$ given by
\begin{equation}
\left.\tilde{r}_{uz \rightarrow sz}\right\rvert_{t+\Delta t} = \min \left(
\frac{ \left. s_{uz} \right\rvert_{t} + \Delta t r_{rz \rightarrow uz}^{pos}}
{T_d \left. s_{sz} \right\rvert_{t} + \Delta t},
\frac{1}{T_d} \right)
\end{equation}
Subsitution of this into the implicit approximation gives
\begin{equation}
\alpha \left. l_{sz}^2 \right\rvert_{t+\Delta t} - \beta \left. l_{sz}
\right\rvert_{t+\Delta t} - \left. l_{sz} \right\rvert_{t} = 0 
\end{equation}
a quadratic expression in $\left.l_{sz}\right\rvert_{t+\Delta t}$ where
\begin{equation}
\beta = \alpha \left(
\frac{ \left. q_{sz}^{-} \right\rvert_{t+\Delta t} }{w} +
\Delta x
\left.\tilde{r}_{uz \rightarrow sz}\right\rvert_{t+\Delta t}
\right) - 1
\end{equation}

The solutions of the quadratic are given by
\begin{equation}
\frac{\beta \pm \sqrt{ \beta^2 +4\alpha\left. l_{sz} \right\rvert_{t} }}{2\alpha}
\end{equation}
Since $\alpha$, $\left. l_{sz} \right\rvert_{t}$ and 
$\left. l_{sz} \right\rvert_{t + \Delta t}$ are greater then zero only the
positive root is valid meaning that
\begin{equation}
\left. l_{sz} \right\rvert_{t + \Delta t} = \frac{1}{\alpha}\left( \beta +
\sqrt{ \beta^2 +4\alpha\left. l_{sz} \right\rvert_{t} } \right)
\end{equation}

Other then evaluating the unsaturated zone storage as
\begin{equation}
\left. s_{uz} \right\rvert_{t + \Delta t} = \min\left(
\left. s_{sz} \right\rvert_{t +\Delta t},
\left. s_{uz} \right\rvert_{t} + \Delta t r^{pos}_{rz \rightarrow uz}
- \Delta t \left.\tilde{r}_{uz \rightarrow sz}\right\rvert_{t+\Delta t}
\right)
\end{equation}
the numerical scheme proceeds as before.



  

# Simulations - TODO

To illustrate the behaviour of the Instantaneous redistribution solution
consider the following set of simulations. Details on the HSU paraemters are
in the attached simualtion code. The details I don't think are overly relevent
but note that $k_{sf} = \infty$, so there is no limit to the flux from the
surface store downwards except for that provided by increasing storage in the
unsaturated and saturated zones.

## Simulation 1

Here a constant lateral flux $l_{sz}^{-} = w^{+} g\left(0\right)$ is input for
600 timesteps (labelled by index idx). The initial saturated storage deficit
is consumed and the laterla outflow converges to the $l_{sz}^{-}$, with no
vertical flux taking place. This seems to be reasonable.

```{r sim1s, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Evolution of states with constant lateral flow to saturated zone eqivilent to potential maximum", out.width = '80%'}
##knitr::include_graphics("Fig_states_IR_1.png")
```

```{r sim1f, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Evolution of fluxes with constant lateral flow to saturated zone eqivilent to potential maximum", out.width = '80%'}
##knitr::include_graphics("Fig_fluxes_IR_1.png")
```

## Simulation 2

Here a constant lateral flux $l_{sf}^{-} = w^{+} g\left(0\right)$ is input to
the surface store for 600 timesteps (labelled by index idx). The initial
storage deficit in the root zone is consumed and the storage in the
unsaturated and saturated zone grows. Note these reach an equilibrum based on
the value of $q_{uz \rightarrow sz}$ when $v_{uz} = v_{sz}$.

```{r sim2s, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Evolution of states with constant lateral flow to the surface zone eqivilent to potential maximum lateral saturated flux", out.width = '80%'}
##knitr::include_graphics("Fig_states_IR_2.png")
```

```{r sim2f, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Evolution of fluxes with constant lateral flow to the surface zone eqivilent to potential maximum lateral saturated flux", out.width = '80%'}
##knitr::include_graphics("Fig_fluxes_IR_2.png")
```

## Simulation 3

In this simulation we consider a constant lateral flux 
$l_{sf}^{-} = w^{+}	g\left(0\right) /4$ to the surface store for all 600
timesteps (labelled by index idx). The initial root zone storage deficit
is consumed then the unsaturated and saturated zone meeting. As this moves
towards an equilibrium surface storage increases and stabalises. 
After step 400 an additional inflow is applied with 
$l_{sz}^{-} = w^{+} g\left(0\right) /2$. This leads to an adjustment to a new
equilibrium for the saturated and unsaturated zones. The surface store
initially deviated and water is returned from the unsaturated zone, then
stabalises to it's previous value.

```{r sim3s, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Evolution of states for Simulation 3", out.width = '80%'}
##knitr::include_graphics("Fig_states_IR_3.png")
```
```{r sim3f, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Evolution of fluxes for Simulation 3", out.width = '80%'}
