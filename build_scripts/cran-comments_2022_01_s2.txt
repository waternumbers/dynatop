Resubmission

Thanks to Gregor Seyer for the constructive feedback.

*Response to previous comments*

Please make sure that you do not change the user's options, par or
working directory...

- where previously the plotting code used `par(mfrow=c(2,1))` this is replaced by 
...
oldpar <- par(no.readonly = TRUE)
on.exit(par(oldpar))
par(mfrow=c(2,1))
...

You are using installed.packages()

- this has been replaced by a call to `requireNamepspace("<package_name>",quiet=TRUE)` to check for availablilty of a suggested package

*Current submission*

Checked without warnings or errors on:
R-patched (OpenSUSE with flags --use-valgrind --as-cran)
win-builder release
win-builder devel
macbuilder
